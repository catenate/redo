This is a minimal edition of redo: more inspired by, than implemented from,
D. J. Bernstein’s description at http://cr.yp.to/redo.html

It is not parallel (so does not have locks), its feature set has been
selectively edited, it stores checksums and generated files in the
same directory as source, it has (and may continue to have) no real
database, and doesn’t have the same interface.

dis/ contains /dis/sh scripts for the acme-sac shell.

test/ contains tests.  test/dis/ builds a Limbo hello-world program
into a Dis executable.  test/do/ creates *.do scripts from a
default.do.do, and then runs them to create files.
